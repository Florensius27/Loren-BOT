GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license forsoftware and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designedto take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom toshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains freesoftware for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use theGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also toany other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it toyour programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, notprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that youhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if youwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in newfree programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying youthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you havecertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or ifyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whethergratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the samefreedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receiveor can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so theyknow their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this Licensegiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explainsthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' andauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked aschanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously toauthors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or runmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturercan do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim ofprotecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematicpattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals touse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, wehave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for thoseproducts. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, westand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versionsof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.States should not allow patents to restrict development and use ofsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish toavoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program couldmake it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures thatpatents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds ofworks, such as semiconductor masks. "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under thisLicense. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and"recipients" may be individuals or organizations. To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the workin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
